# PhotoVoyage Translations Repository

Welcome to our PhotoVoyage translations repository!

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to collecting both official and community translations for the PhotoVoyage website. PhotoVoyage is an online platform dedicated to photography, and our goal is to make content available to a wider audience by offering translations in various languages.

## Why this repository?

We understand the importance of linguistic diversity and want to ensure that people from different parts of the world can access PhotoVoyage content in their native language. This repository provides a platform for both the community and official translators to contribute their language skills to achieve this goal.

## How to contribute?

- If you are an official PhotoVoyage translator, you can upload your translations here for others to review and collaborate on improving if necessary.
- If you are part of the community and would like to contribute a translation in your language, you are welcome! Make sure to have a good command of the language and avoid using machine translation tools.
- Before starting to translate, make sure to check if a translation already exists for the language you have in mind. If not, go ahead!
